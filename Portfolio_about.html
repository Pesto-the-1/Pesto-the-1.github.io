        <P>My name is Kolya Taylor, and I am an incoming Junior at Warren Central High School.</P>
        <p>I do two main extracurriculars at my school, and those are cross country and the esports club.</p>
        <p>Some of my hobbys are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Running</li>
            <li>Reading</li>
            <li>Playing video games</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now, when it comes to my running career, I have done quite a few things.</p>
        <p>For example, I have run three half marathons, and my best time for a 5K is 19:55.</p>
        <p>I know HTML and CSS as coding languages fairly well, while I can manage to do some things with Javascript.</p>
